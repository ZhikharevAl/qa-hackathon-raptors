# Bug Report: User Creation API Endpoint Failure for [TestCase 005](/docs/TestCases/Test_case_create_user_004.md)

**ID**: BUG-005
**Title**: Internal Server Error During User Creation (Task-Id: api-22)

---

## Description

The user creation API endpoint returns an HTTP 500 Internal Server Error when attempting to create a new user with Task-Id api-22, preventing successful user registration.

---

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Prepare user creation request with:
   - Task-Id: api-22
   - Standard user creation payload
2. Send POST request to `/users` endpoint
3. Observe API response

---

## Expected Result

- Successful user creation
- HTTP 200 status code
- Valid user object returned

---

## Actual Result

- HTTP 500 Internal Server Error
- No user created
- Error raised in user API client

---

## Technical Details

- Error Location: `services/users/user_api_client.py`
- Method: `create_user()`
- Error Handling: Raises `ValueError` with status code
- Specific Status: 500 (Internal Server Error)

---

## Impact

High - Blocks new user registration process

- Prevents user onboarding
- Disrupts system functionality
- Potential loss of user acquisition

---

## Recommended Actions

1. Investigate server-side error logs
2. Check API endpoint implementation
3. Verify database connection and transaction handling
4. Review request payload validation
5. Implement comprehensive error logging
6. Add more detailed error reporting mechanisms

---

## Potential Root Causes

- Database connection issues
- Payload validation failures
- Unhandled exceptions in user creation logic
- Middleware or server configuration problems

---

## Additional Notes

- Error is consistent for Task-Id api-22
- Requires immediate investigation and resolution
- May indicate deeper systemic issues in user creation workflow

---

## Reproducibility

- Consistently reproducible
- Specific to Task-Id api-22
- Requires thorough debugging
