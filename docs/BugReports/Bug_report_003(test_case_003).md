# Bug Report [for the test case 003](/docs/TestCases/Test_case_003_delete_user.md)

**ID**: BUG-003
**Title**: API Fails to Delete User - Internal Server Error

---

## Description

When attempting to delete a user by UUID, the API returns an internal server error (HTTP 500), preventing successful user deletion.

---

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Create a new user in the test environment
2. Send a `DELETE /users/{user_uuid}` request with:
   - Task-Id: api-1
   - User UUID: Newly created user's UUID

3. Observe API response

---

## Expected Result

- Successful deletion of the user
- HTTP 204 status code
- Response containing the deleted user's UUID

---

## Actual Result

- HTTP 500 Internal Server Error
- No user deleted
- No meaningful error message returned

---

## Impact

High - This prevents users from being removed from the system, potentially causing:
- Data accumulation
- Performance degradation
- Compliance and privacy issues

---

## Recommended Actions

1. Investigate server-side error handling in delete endpoint
2. Check database transaction management
3. Review user deletion logic
4. Implement comprehensive error logging
5. Verify database constraints and cascading deletes

---

## Additional Notes

- Error occurs consistently in test environment
- Requires immediate attention to ensure API reliability
