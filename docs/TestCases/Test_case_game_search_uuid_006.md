# Test Case: Validate Game Retrieval by UUID

**ID**: TC-GAMES-002
**Objective**: Verify Successful Game Details Retrieval

## Description

Ensure game retrieval API works correctly and returns complete game details for a specific UUID

## Preconditions

1. Games API is available
2. Authorization is performed
3. Test environment is prepared
4. Game UUID is valid and exists

## Test Steps

1. Prepare a game UUID
2. Call `get_game` method
3. Validate response structure
4. Verify game details

## Test Data

- Task-Id: `api-9`
- UUID: `03dbad48-ad81-433d-9901-dd5332f5d9ee`

## Expected Result

- Successful API call
- HTTP status code 200 OK
- Complete game details returned
- Passed Pydantic model validation
- Returned UUID matches requested UUID

## Validation Checks

- Verify response is not empty
- Validate all required game fields
- Check UUID consistency
- Ensure price is non-negative
- Confirm all model constraints are met

## Postconditions

- Clear test data
- No side effects observed

## Risks

- Potential data inconsistency
- Performance degradation

## Acceptance Criteria

- Successful game retrieval
- Correct game data
- Model validation passed
- UUID match confirmed

## Test Environment

- API Endpoint: `/games/{uuid}`
- Test Framework: pytest
- Validation: Pydantic models

## Additional Considerations

- Error handling
- Performance testing
- Edge case scenarios
