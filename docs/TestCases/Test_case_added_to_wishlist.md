# Test Case: Add Game to User Wishlist

**ID**: TC-WISHLIST-001
**Objective**: Verify Game Addition to User Wishlist

## Description

Ensure users can successfully add a game to their wishlist with different task IDs and validate the response.

## Preconditions

1. Wishlist API is available
2. User is authenticated
3. Game UUID is valid
4. Test environment is prepared

## Test Steps

1. Create a new user
2. Prepare a valid game UUID
3. Call `add_an_item_to_wishlist` method
4. Validate response structure
5. Verify wishlist contents

## Test Data

- Task-Ids:
  - `api-5`
  - `api-25`
- Game UUID: `03dbad48-ad81-433d-9901-dd5332f5d9ee`
- Expected Fields:
  - `user_uuid`: Matches created user
  - `items`: Contains added game
  - `items[0].uuid`: Matches input game UUID

## Expected Result

- HTTP Status Code: 200 OK
- Successful wishlist update
- Wishlist contains exactly one game item
- Game UUID matches input

## Validation Checks

1. Response validation using Pydantic model
2. User UUID consistency
3. Wishlist item count
4. Game UUID verification

## Postconditions

- Restore initial state
- Remove added game from wishlist
- Verify no side effects

## Risks

- Potential data integrity issues
- Unauthorized wishlist modifications

## Acceptance Criteria

- Successful game addition
- Correct response format
- Consistent user and game data

## Test Environment

- API Endpoint: `/wishlist/add`
- Test Framework: pytest
- Validation: Pydantic models

## Additional Considerations

- Test with multiple game UUIDs
- Edge case handling
- Performance testing
